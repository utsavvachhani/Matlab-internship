I can’t directly clone or push code for you, but here is the **exact step-by-step procedure** you should follow on your system to complete this practical correctly.

---

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open **Git Bash / Terminal** and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/varshilMatlabInfotech/React-practical.git
```

👉 **Important:**
Do **NOT** share personal access tokens publicly.
Your URL already contains a token — use the clean URL above.

---

## Step 2: Go Inside the Project Folder

```bash
cd React-practical
```

---

## Step 3: Create a Branch With *Your Name*

Use your name (example: `utsav`):

```bash
git checkout -b utsav
```

Check branch:

```bash
git branch
```

✅ Your name branch should be highlighted.

---

## Step 4: Do the Practical Work

* Open the project in VS Code
* Complete all required React tasks
* Test the app properly

---

## Step 5: Check Changed Files

```bash
git status
```

---

## Step 6: Add & Commit Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Completed React practical"
```

---

## Step 7: Push Code to **Your Branch Only**

```bash
git push origin utsav
```

---

## ✅ Final Checklist (Very Important)

✔ Repository cloned
✔ Branch created with **your name**
✔ Work done only on **your branch**
✔ Code pushed successfully

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

* ❌ Don’t push to `main` or `master`
* ❌ Don’t delete others’ code
* ❌ Don’t share access tokens
* ✅ Always work in your own branch

---

If you want, tell me:

* Your **exact practical task**
