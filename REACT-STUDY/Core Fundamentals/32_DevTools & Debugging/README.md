# ⚙️ 32. DevTools & Debugging

---

## 📘 Overview

Debugging and performance profiling are essential parts of React development.
React provides its own **Developer Tools**, and you can also use **Browser DevTools** to analyze components, inspect states, props, and measure performance.

---

## 🔹 React Developer Tools

React Developer Tools is a browser extension available for **Chrome**, **Edge**, and **Firefox**.
It allows you to inspect React components just like you inspect HTML elements in DevTools.

🔗 **Install Extension:**
👉 [React Developer Tools (Chrome)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi)

### 🧩 Key Features

1️⃣ **Components Tab**

* Displays your app’s component tree.
* Lets you inspect **props**, **state**, and **hooks** values in real time.
* Shows **which components re-render** when state changes.

💡 *Tip:* Components are color-coded — blue for mounted, gray for unmounted, etc.

2️⃣ **Profiler Tab**

* Used to measure app performance and rendering speed.
* Helps identify components that re-render unnecessarily.

---

## 🔹 Profiler Tab

The **Profiler** helps you analyze performance by recording render timings.

### 🧠 How to Use:

1. Open **React Developer Tools** → **Profiler** tab.
2. Click **“Start Profiling”** to begin recording interactions.
3. Perform actions in your app (like button clicks, navigation).
4. Click **“Stop Profiling”** to review results.

### 📊 Profiler Output:

* **Flamegraph View:** Shows which components took the most render time.
* **Ranked View:** Lists components sorted by render duration.

### 💡 Optimization Tips:

* Use `React.memo()` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
* Use `useCallback()` and `useMemo()` for expensive computations.
* Split large components into smaller, reusable ones.

## 🔹 Browser DevTools Integration

React integrates seamlessly with browser developer tools for **debugging logic, network calls, and styling issues**.

### 🧩 Key Tabs to Use

1️⃣ **Console Tab**

* Debug React states or props directly.
* Example:

  ```js
  console.log("Current count:", count);
  ```
* Use `console.table()` to print arrays/objects in a readable format.

2️⃣ **Elements Tab**

* Inspect DOM nodes generated by React.
* Useful for checking **CSS issues** or **DOM structure**.

3️⃣ **Network Tab**

* Analyze API requests made from React (useful with `fetch()` or `axios`).
* Check response status, latency, and payload data.

4️⃣ **Sources Tab**

* Set **breakpoints** in your React code.
* Step through your logic to find errors or unexpected behavior.

5️⃣ **Performance Tab**

* Analyze CPU and memory usage for large React renders.
* Detect layout thrashing or long-running JavaScript tasks.

## 🔹 Debugging React Apps

### 🧩 Common Debugging Techniques

✅ **Add Debug Points:**

```js
debugger;
```

When executed, the browser pauses script execution at this point.

✅ **Log Props and State:**
Use `console.log()` or custom debug hooks to track runtime values.

✅ **React StrictMode:**
Wrap your app in `<React.StrictMode>` to identify potential issues in development mode.

✅ **React Error Boundaries:**
Catch UI-level errors to prevent app crashes.

## 🔹 Example: Using Debugger and Console

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  const handleIncrement = () => {
    console.log("Before increment:", count);
    debugger; // pause here to inspect variables
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Count: {count}</h3>
      <button onClick={handleIncrement}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
